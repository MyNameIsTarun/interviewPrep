/*
 * what is Immutability and immutable class?
 * => An object is considered immutable if its state cannot change after it is constructed.
 * 
 * why immutability introduced in java?
 * => Immutable objects are particularly useful in concurrent applications. Since they cannot change state, 
 * => they cannot be corrupted by thread interference or observed in an inconsistent state.
 * => An immutable class is good for caching purposes because you donâ€™t have to worry about the value changes.
 * 
 * why it is necessary to make immutable class final?
 * => it is not necessary.
 * => https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/imstrat.html
 * 
 * what happens if we don't make it final?
 * => It means that other classes could potentially extend it. 
 * => Extending an immutable class can introduce challenges and potential risks to the immutability guarantees. 
 * 
 * why instance variables of immutable class are declared private final?
 * => Private so that they can't be accessed from outside of the class hence their value cannot be changed.
 * => While it is technically possible to create an immutable class without marking instance variables as final, 
 * => doing so reinforces the immutability contract, enhances thread safety, and contributes to the overall clarity and predictability of the code. 
 * => Therefore, it is a recommended practice to use final for instance variables in immutable classes.
 * 
 * what happens if we try to extend immutable class?
 * => If class is final then we get compile time error.
 * 
 * Collections.unmodifiableList() internals?
 * => this method returns the object of Unmodifiable list, which acts as a wrapper of user defined list
 * => Collections class has static Unmodifiable class which has one instance variable of type list which declared as final,
 * => and in the constructor of this class it takes a list and simply assign it to its final list instance variable,
 * => this class has all the methods of a list and except for the get operation methods (eg: get(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf()) 
 * => it will throw UnSupportedException for all other methods which tries to modify the list.
 * => it does the same thing with its iterator also, that means from the iterable also we can't modify the list (ie, remove() will not work)
 * => This wrapper class delegates all read-only operations to the original list but throws exceptions for any attempts to modify the list. 
 * => The wrapper class ensures that the immutability contract is maintained.
 * 
 * Generic way of deep copying mutable and nested mutable objects?
 * => https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59906453/java-using-reflection-for-deep-copy-object
 * 
 * Other ways of deep copying?
 * => make the mutable class implement either serializable or cloneable interface.
 * => because we can serialize and then deserialize the mutable object to deep copy it, and object.clone() will also return a diff object
 * 
 * How using reflection we can access the private instance variable and change data of final variables?
 * How to save this class from reflection?
